Database:
The database is a collection of inter-related data which is used to retrieve, insert and delete the data efficiently. It is also used to organize the data in the form of a table, schema, views, and reports, etc.
Database Management System
+Database management system is a software which is used to manage the database. For example: MySQL, Oracle, etc are a very popular commercial database which is used in different applications.
+DBMS provides an interface to perform various operations like database creation, storing data in it, updating data, creating a table in the database and a lot more+.
+It provides protection and security to the database. In the case of multiple users, it also maintains data consistency.

DBMS allows users the following tasks:

+Data Definition: It is used for creation, modification, and removal of definition that defines the organization of data in the database.
+Data Updation: It is used for the insertion, modification, and deletion of the actual data in the database.
+Data Retrieval: It is used to retrieve the data from the database which can be used by applications for various purposes.
+User Administration: It is used for registering and monitoring users, maintain data integrity, enforcing data security, dealing with concurrency control, monitoring performance and recovering information corrupted by unexpected failure.

Characteristics of DBMS:
It uses a digital repository established on a server to store and manage the information.
It can provide a clear and logical view of the process that manipulates data.
DBMS contains automatic backup and recovery procedures.
It contains ACID properties which maintain data in a healthy state in case of failure.
It can reduce the complex relationship between data.
It is used to support manipulation and processing of data.
It is used to provide security of data.
It can view the database from different viewpoints according to the requirements of the user.

Types of operators in SQL:

1.Arithematic Operators,
2.Comparison Operators
3.Logical Operators

1.Arithematic Operators:a.Addtion Operator(+): Adds values on either side of the operator.
Eg consider the Sailor table

Select 5*3 from dual; 

     5*3                     
--------
      15

Select 15/2 from dual; 

    15/2
